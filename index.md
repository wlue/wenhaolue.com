## Hi, I’m Wen-Hao Lue.

I’m a Software Engineer based in San Francisco with a passion for engineering
and design. I enjoy solving challenging, high-impact problems and building
products that are delightful to use with solid technical foundations. I’m
especially excited about zero-to-one work where I can take deep ownership and
help shape both technical architecture and product experiences.

Most recently, I worked at [Stripe] for four years as a Software Engineer,
responsible for many projects on the [Connect] team. Before that, I co-founded
[Sesame], an ed-tech start-up, and we went through [Imagine-K12] during the Fall
2015 cohort.

Previously, I worked at [Twitter], writing [monoids] for [Map-Reduce] jobs
in Scala, and writing CoffeeScript for [Answers] on the [Crashlytics] team. I
previously worked at [Square] as an iOS Engineer, developing features for
[Square Register].

In the past, I worked on [various projects] and contributed to open source
projects on [GitHub], such as [PonyDebugger].
