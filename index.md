## Hi, I’m Wen-Hao Lue.

I’m a programmer, musician, and I dabble in design. I studied
[Software Engineering] at the [University of Waterloo], and graduated in 2014.
I'm currently a Software Engineer at [Stripe] working on [Connect].

I co-founded [Sesame], an ed-tech start-up, and we went through [Imagine-K12]
during the Fall 2015 cohort.

Previously, I worked at [Twitter], writing [monoids] for [Map-Reduce] jobs
in Scala, and writing CoffeeScript for [Answers] on the [Crashlytics] team. I
previously worked at [Square] as an iOS Engineer, developing features for
[Square Register].

In the past, I worked on [various projects] and contributed to open source
projects on [GitHub], such as [PonyDebugger].

## Shall we talk?

The best way to contact me is through [email]. You can also ping me [@wlue] on
Twitter. Check out my [resume].
